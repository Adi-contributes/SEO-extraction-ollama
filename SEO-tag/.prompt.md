      <h1>The Future of Renewable Energy</h1>
      <p>
        As the world faces the pressing challenges of climate change, the demand
        for clean and renewable sources of energy continues to grow.
        Technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric systems
        are becoming increasingly efficient and affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governments and private sectors are investing in sustainable
        infrastructure and research, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
        Innovations in battery storage, smart grids, and decentralized energy
        systems are playing a crucial role in this transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2050, renewable energy is expected to become the dominant source of
        electricity worldwide. This shift not only supports environmental goals
        but also promises economic growth and energy security across the globe.
